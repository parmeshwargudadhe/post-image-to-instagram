## Post an Imnage to Instagram

This Python script allows you to publish an image on Instagram using the Instagram Graph API.

### Prerequisites

1. You need an access token from Instagram to authenticate your requests.
2. Obtain your Instagram user ID.
3. Provide the URL of the image you want to post.

### How to Use

* Make sure you have installed the necessary Python packages: `json` and `requests`.
* Open the script and replace the following placeholders with your actual information:
    - `ACCESS-TOKEN`: Replace with your Instagram access token.
    - `INSTAGRAM-ID`: Replace with your Instagram user ID.
    - `IMAGE-URL`: Replace with the URL of the image you want to post.
* Run the script.

### Example

```
# Replace the placeholders with your actual information
access_token = "YOUR-ACCESS-TOKEN"
ig_user_id = "YOUR-INSTAGRAM-ID"
image_url = "URL-OF-YOUR-IMAGE"

# Call the function
publish_image()
```

### Important Notes

* Make sure you have the necessary permissions to post on Instagram using the Graph API.
* This script uses version 18.0 of the Facebook Graph API. Ensure compatibility with future versions if necessary.
